\subsection{Scope}

% TODO: expand this part, give a more detailed scope of the project (more organic)
The project scope covers users interacting with the system, user-generated actions that influence the system, and system-generated actions that impact the outside world.

% 
% maybe here we could define the distinction between the two types of data insertion and user, but give the detailed definition later? mh something to reason about it a little bit more
For this project, the following users interacting with the system have been identified:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Registered User}
    \item \textbf{Any User} 
\end{itemize}

A Registered User will be able to use the application to log and store their trips, tracking their cycling activities and related 
statistics. When available, this data can be enriched with weather information retrieved from external services. Furthermore, this user is the primary contributor to 
the inventory. They can enter route information in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In \textbf{manual mode}, by actively specifying the route status (e.g., optimal, requires maintenance) and the presence of obstacles (e.g., potholes).
    \item In \textbf{automatic mode}, by allowing the app to acquire data from GPS and mobile device sensors while cycling, in order to automatically detect potential 
    problems such as potholes.
\end{enumerate}

For automatically collected data, the system will ask the user to confirm or correct the information before making it available to the community. Once confirmed or 
manually entered, this information becomes publishable.

Any user, whether registered or not, can benefit from the collected information. This user can specify a starting point and a destination and ask the system 
to display available cycling routes on a map. If multiple routes exist, BBP will present them based on a score, calculated based on the route status derived from the 
data confirmed by users.

\subsubsection{World phenomena}
%Eventi che accadono nel mondo reale, che il sistema non può né controllare né osservare. Sono le intenzioni o le azioni fisiche degli utenti.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{WP1:} A registered user starts a cycling activity.
    \item \textbf{WP2:} Any user searches for a cycling route between two places.
    \item \textbf{WP3:} A registered user contributes contribute to the BBP inventory.
    \item \textbf{WP4:} While pedaling a registred user ecounters some kind of problem on the route.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Shared phenomena}
\paragraph{World controlled}
%Azioni che l'utente (mondo) compie sull'interfaccia del sistema. Il sistema deve reagirvi, ma non può avviarle. Sono gli input dell'utente.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC1:} The registered user launches starts to register the trip with the application.
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC2:} The registered user stops to register the trip with the application.
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC3:} The registered user opens the interface for manually entering route information.
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC4:} The registered user enters the data (e.g. "optimal" status, "hole" presence) and sends the manual entry form.
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC5:} The registered user selects a notification or confirmation request for automatically detected data.
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC6:} The registered user confirms to validate automatically the detected data (e.g. a pothole).
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC7:} The registered user deletes to invalidate an automatically detected data (false positive).
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC8:} The registered user modifies an automatically detected piece of data (e.g. corrects the position of the hole on the map) and saves the change.
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC9:} Any user enters a source and destination address.
    \item \textbf{SP\_WC10:} Any user starts the route search.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Machine controlled}
%Azioni che il sistema (macchina) compie sull'interfaccia e che l'utente (mondo) può osservare. Sono gli output del sistema.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SP\_MC1:} The system shows the statistics of the completed trip to the registered user.
    \item \textbf{SP\_MC2:} The system shows the weather data associated with the trip to the registered user.
    \item \textbf{SP\_MC3:} The system presents the Registered User with a confirmation request for automatically detected data.
    \item \textbf{SP\_MC4:} The system shows the user a map with the cycling routes found between the origin and the destination.
    \item \textbf{SP\_MC5:} The system displays the details of a route, including its score and confirmed obstacles.
    \item \textbf{SP\_MC6:} The system displays an error message (e.g., "Weather service unavailable").
\end{itemize}
