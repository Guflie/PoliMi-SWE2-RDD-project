\subsubsection{Requirement Mapping}
    This section maps the Goals identified in Section 1 to the Functional Requirements and Domain Assumptions. This mapping demonstrates that 
    the set of requirements, supported by the assumptions, is sufficient to satisfy the system goals ($R \land D \models G$).
